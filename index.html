        <p class="modal-para">Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold": <br>  <br>
          <ul class="modal-para">
            <li>If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.</li> <br>
            <li>If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.</li> <br>

            For example, the first player, Donald, begins a turn with a roll of 5. Donald could hold and score 5 points, but chooses to roll again. Donald rolls a 2, and could hold with a turn total of 7 points, but chooses to roll again. Donald rolls a 1, and must end his turn without scoring. The next player, Alexis, rolls the sequence 4-5-3-5-5, after which she chooses to hold, and adds her turn total of 22 points to her score.</p>
